# voting-system
An online voting system 

# Synopsis
- I want to look at how safe online elections can be, I beleive that elections should stay offline as much as they can, except for counting which always is easier and more reliable when done by computers. I need to see data integrity, a safe system and voter anonymity, while still being able to track each vote. 
- I will use Java (SpringBoot) for the Backend and use Javascript (React) for frontend.
- I expect to have a working project in 3months, The consistency model.
